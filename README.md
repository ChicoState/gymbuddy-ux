# GymBuddy

Gym Buddy is a platform that helps gym-goers find workout partners based on their fitness goals and schedules. The project addresses a common challengeâ€”many people struggle to stay motivated and consistent with their fitness routines due to a lack of accountability and social support. During this phase, we focused on analyzing competitors, created a structured layout of our design, and ran situational tests through personas and scenarios.
